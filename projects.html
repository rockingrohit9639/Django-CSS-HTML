<h3>The London Sustainability Hub</h3>
<h4>December 2018 - March 2018</h4>
<p>For this project I created a localhost website which was due to be published on June 2018. To do this I used Windows Powershell, pip, python and Django for backend. For frontend I used CSS and HTML. Unfortuneately due to an issue with funding the website could not be published.</p>
